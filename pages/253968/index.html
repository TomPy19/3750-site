    <br>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Use obvious words for labels and links.</h3>
    <p>The Google homepage has a simple search bar with the label "Search". The user knows exactly what to do and where to click to search for something on the web.</p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google.com<i class="fas fa-up-right-from-square"></i></a>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Make your interface self-explanatory.</h3>
    <p>The Apple website has a clean and simple design with clear navigation. Users can easily find the information they are looking for without having to read any instructions.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Use visual affordances to indicate what is clickable and tappable.</h3>
    <p>Airbnb uses visual affordances such as buttons, links, and icons to indicate what elements on the page are interactive. This makes it easy for users to know what they can click on and what will happen when they do.</p>

    <br>
    <br><br>
    <h2>Violations</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Don't make me think.</h3>
    <p>Goodyear's homepage is cluttered with too much text, too many images, and too many links. This makes it difficult for users to quickly and easily find what they're looking for.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Don't force me to figure it out.</h3>
    <p>The USPS website's shipping instructions are complex and confusing. For example, users are required to enter a variety of information, such as the weight and dimensions of their package, the shipping destination, and the type of shipping service they want.</p>

    <br><br>
    <h3>Don't make me go back and forth.</h3>
    <p>Bank of America's money transfer process requires users to go back and forth between pages. This can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially if users make a mistake and have to go back and start over.</p>
