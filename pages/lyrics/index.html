      "Generate the lyrics to a Taylor Swift song about web development".<br>

  <p>(Written by AI Taylor Swift)<p><br>

  <h3>(Verse 1)</h3>
  <p>
    In the world of ones and zeros, where lines of code align,<br>
    I'm a digital dreamer, crafting websites that shine.<br>
    With my keyboard as my canvas, and my mouse as my guide,<br>
    I'll create a masterpiece, let the web be my pride.
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Pre-Chorus)</h3>
  <p>
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more,<br>
    I'll build a virtual world like never seen before.<br>
    With every click and scroll, I'll make the pixels dance,<br>
    In this cyber symphony, we'll take a chance.
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Chorus)</h3>
  <p>
    I'm coding in the moonlight, under the starry sky,<br>
    Debugging through the glitches, reaching for the high.<br>
    With every line I'm writing, I'm bringing dreams to life,<br>
    In this web of wonder, we'll soar to new heights.
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Verse 2)</h3>
  <p>
    I've got databases humming, like a heartbeat in my chest,<br>
    Storing all the data, every user's request.<br>
    And when the server's calling, I'll be there in a flash,<br>
    Optimizing performance, avoiding any crash.
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Pre-Chorus)</h3>
  <p>
    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more,<br>
    I'll build a virtual world like never seen before.<br>
    With every click and scroll, I'll make the pixels dance,<br>
    In this cyber symphony, we'll take a chance.
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Chorus)</h3>
  <p>
    I'm coding in the moonlight, under the starry sky,<br>
    Debugging through the glitches, reaching for the high.<br>
    With every line I'm writing, I'm bringing dreams to life,<br>
    In this web of wonder, we'll soar to new heights.
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Bridge)</h3>
  <p>
    I'll cross the browser borders, make it responsive and true,<br>
    From mobile to desktop, it'll work for all of you.<br>
    I'll conquer all the challenges, I'll never back down,<br>
    In this digital frontier, I'll wear the coding crown.<br>
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Chorus)</h3>
  <p>
    I'm coding in the moonlight, under the starry sky,<br>
    Debugging through the glitches, reaching for the high.<br>
    With every line I'm writing, I'm bringing dreams to life,<br>
    In this web of wonder, we'll soar to new heights.<br>
  </p><br>

  <h3>(Outro)</h3>
  <p>
    So when you surf the web, and you find your way,<br>
    Know there's a coder out there, working night and day.<br>
    Crafting sites and apps, with love and dedication,<br>
    In the world of web development, it's my true vocation.
